### EvenOdd-Synchronizer
This shows an [EvenOdd-Synchronizer](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2010-05_The-Even/Odd-Synchronizer%3A//05476986.pdf) implementation by a research paper from a Nvidia Research Group.

A all-digital synchronizer that moves multi-bit Signals between two periodic 
clock domains with an average delay of sligthly more than a  half cycle and 
an arbitrarily small probability of synchronization failure.
The synchronizer operates by measuring the relative frequency of the two periodic
clocks and using this frequency measurement, along with a phase
detection, to compute a phase estimate. 
Interval arithmetic is used for the phase estimate to account for uncertainty. 
The transmitter writes a pair of registers on alternating clock cycles and the
receiver uses the estimate of the transmitterâ€™s phase to always
select the most recently written value that is safe to sample.

The synchronizer should work for all frequency combinations, according the [research paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2010-05_The-Even/Odd-Synchronizer%3A//05476986.pdf).
